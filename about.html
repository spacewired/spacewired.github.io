<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> I graduated in May of 2018 from The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
After graduating I began to work as a Research Engineer at the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at the Intelligent Systems Center (ISC).
I am actively persuing a Masters degree in Computer Science at JHU while working full-time at the lab.  
From the ISC I works on projects related to Big Data and Machine Learning and am also a Flight Software Engineer working on NASA's
Double Asteroid Redirection Task (DART) </p>

<p>From a very young age I have been interested in space and the wonders of the cosmos. Spacewired is an outlet for me share 
my passion for space while, hopefully, helping to quckly inform you on some awesome things going on in space.</p>
