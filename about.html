<h2>About SpaceWired</h2>

<p> The purpose of SpaceWired is to provide short breakdowns of topics related to the space industry, planetary science, theoretical physics, 
and engineering. Some posts will be quick discussions about recent news in the industry, while others are simplified summaries of 
interesting research papers I find. You'll also notice that I'll occasionally throw in a post on something new I've learned related to the Computer Science
field and hopefully can be useful to someone else. Thought I'd throw those in for seasoning :) .</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> I graduated in May of 2018 from The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
After graduating I began to work as a Research Engineer at the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at the Intelligent Systems Center (ISC).
I am actively persuing a Masters degree in Computer Science at JHU while working full-time at the lab.  
From the ISC I works on projects developing a Big Data cloud infrastructure called BOSS and developing machine learning segmentation algorithms. </p>

<p> At APL I also have the privilage of working as a Flight Software Engineer on NASA's Planetary Defense Double Asteroid Redirection Task (DART) and am
an active member of the Planetary Society.</p>

<p> Feel free to comment and ask questions in the comment sections.</p>

<p> ENJOY! </p>
