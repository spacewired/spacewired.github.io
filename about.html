<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> I graduated in May of 2018 from The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.
After graduating I began to work as a Research Engineer at the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at the Intelligent Systems Center (ISC).
I am actively persuing a Masters degree in Computer Science at JHU while working full-time at the lab.  
From the ISC I works on projects managing Big Data cloud infrastructure and developing Machine Learning 
algorithms to process it. I also work as a Flight Software Engineer on NASA's
Double Asteroid Redirection Task (DART) and am a member of the Planetary Society.</p>

<p>I created Spacewired to share
the passion I have for space, and to share with you all the cool things going on in the space industry, planetary science
and engineering.</p>
