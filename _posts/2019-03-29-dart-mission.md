The Double Asteroid Redirection Task (DART) is going to sound like a sci-fi movie, but trust me it is actually happening!

As I type this post a team of engineers and scientists work out of the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory in the first mission funded out of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. 

DART is scheduled to be the first mission to test the capacity of using kinetic impact to veer an asteroid off of its current trayectory in the hopes that we have a better understanding of what to do in the case we ever found an Earth threatening asteroid in the cosmos. 

The mission will target a binary system called Didymos (Figure 1). In the system Didymos B (otherwise known as Dydimoon) orbits Didymos (also known as... well... just Didymos).

The Didymos binary system was chosen for several reasons. Not only is it easier to understand the effects of the kinetic impact on a binary system by allowing observers to check orbit changes of one asteroid around the other, but also for it's location and composition. Didymos will pass close to Earth in 2022 and obeservations of DART's impact by ground and space-based assets will be easier and provide more data than the spacecraft's camera itself could. Didymos also has a composition very akin to ordinary chondrite meteorites which means that the effects of this experiment apply to a wider set of samples classified as Pontentially Hazardous Asteroids. 

The DART spacecraft itself is quite a marble as well (Figure 2)! In 15-18 months of flight the spacecraft is scheduled to demonstrate two new technological capabilities in space and will prepare for the encounter with Didymos at the end of it's trajectory.

DART will make use of NASA's NEXT-C engine (Figure 3), an electric propulsion system that uses ions to propel the spacecraft. The spacecraft will also use state of the art software, an algorithm APL is calling SMART Nav (Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real-Time Navigation) will be used to autonomously guide the spacecraft to it's target. Throughout the flight the spacecraft will be flown with the Guidance, Navigation and Control flight software, but near impact, the navigation control is handed over to SMART Nav to target Didymos B and hit it!

The natural next question is how the spacecraft will see the asteroid to begin with? Will we get cool images? The answer to both questions is YES! DART will be using the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Op-nav (DRACO), which is a high resolution imager inspired from New Horizons' LORRI camera. 

The spacecraft will indeed be quite small in comparison (Figure 4) to the asteroid it will be hitting, but at the speed it is going it should definetely cause a great enough impact to create a delta in the orbits of the binary system members.
