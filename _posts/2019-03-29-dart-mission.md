The Double Asteroid Redirection Task (DART) is going to sound like a really "out of this world" sci-fi movie, but trust me it is actually happening!

As I type this article a team of engineers and scientists work out of the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory in the first mission funded out of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. 

DART's objective is scheduled to be the first mission to test the capacity of using kinetic impact to veer an asteroid off of its current trayectory in the hopes that in the case the Earth was ever threatened by an asteroid we had data to help us make the best decision about the best way to save the world. 

The mission will target a binary system called Didymos (Figure 1). In the system Didymos B (otherwise known as Dydimoon) orbits Didymos (also known as... well... just Didymos).

The Didymos binary system was chosen for several reasons. Not only is it easier to understand the effects of the kinetic impact on a binary system by allowing observers to check orbit changes of one asteroid around the other but also for it's location and composition. Didymos will pass close to Earth in 2022 and obeservations of DART's impact by ground and space-based assets will be easier and provide more data than the spacecraft itself. Didymos also has a composition very akin to ordinary chondrite meteorites which means that the effects of this experiment apply to a wider set of samples classified as Pontentially Hazardous Asteroids. 

The DART spacecraft itself is quite a marble as well (Figure 2)! In 15-18 months of flight the spacecraft will demonstrate two new technological capabilities in space and will prepare for the encounter with Didymos at the end of it's trajectory.

DART will make use of NASA's NEXT-C engine (Figure 3), an electric propulsion system that uses ions to propel the spacecraft. The spacecraft will also use a SMART Nav (Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real-Time Navigation) algortihm to autonomously guide the spacecraft to it's target. Throughout the flight the spacecraft will be flown with the Guidance, Navigation and Control flight software, however near impact, the navigation control is handed over to SMART Nav to target Didymos B and hit it!

The natural question is how is the spacecraft seeing the asteroid to begin with? Will we get cool images? The answer to the both of those is YES! DART will be using the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Op-nav (DRACO), which is a high resolution imager inspired from New Horizons' LORRI camera. 

The spacecraft will indeed be quite small in comparison (Figure 4) to the asteroid it will be hitting, but at the speed it is going it should definetely cause a great enough impact to notice a delta in the orbits of the binary system members.

If you made it all the way down to the end of this post, then I think it is only fair I share a little interesting fact about this mission; I am actually a Flight Software in the DART team! In the time that I have been part of the team I must say it is an extremely fun mission, and the fellow scientists and engineers working on the mission are a lot of fun to work with! 

Everyday I work on this mission, I want to work more on it! I can't wait to HIT THAT ASTEROID!
