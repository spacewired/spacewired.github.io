# The Roll-Out Solar Array
#### An amazing underdog
Many of us already know about these underdogs, but do not completely appreciate how amazing they are, so I have decided to give you a quick couple of pointers on who they are and why they're special. 

Solar panels are an efficient way to power spacecraft and other satellites, however most are too large and too delicate to carry up to space without meeting special conditions. The Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) is NASA's innovative solution to this limitation.

The ROSA design uses high strain one-piece coposite slit-tube booms. The energy stored is then used, once in space, to quickly deploy the solar panels once in space.

The panels have successfully been tested at the international space station, and will now be used by the NASA's planetary defense department in the Double Asteroid Redirection Task (DART). The compact nature of the spacecraft aimed at hitting Dydimos provides the perfect opportunity to use ROSA.
