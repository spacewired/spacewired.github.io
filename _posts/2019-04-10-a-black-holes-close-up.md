This morning I could not contain my excitement as I watched the live feed from the National Science Foundation (NSF) where scientists were scheduled to release one of the biggest, most impressive things, my generation might ever get to see. The first image of a black whole was released today by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Today the effort an coordination of a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes has paid off. The Event Horizon Telescope is said to be "an earth-sized telescope", technically because it is! The telescope in essence is the successful connection of a worldwide network of eight pre-existing telescopes deployed at a variety of challenging high-altitude sites which included,Hawai'i, Mexico, Arixon, Spanish, CHile and Antartica.

The image released today is that at the heart of a distant galaxy Messier 87. While the EHT has been focused in capturing an image of the black hole at the center of our galaxy as well, the much larger size of the black hole in the Virgo galaxy and the location of it in respect to our current location in our own galaxy, made the Messier 87 black hole easier to capture.

Since the first mention of big news being released this Wednesday morning, astronomers began to ponder what the next steps would be if the first images of a black hole revealed an unexpected shape of the light bent around the black hole. The scientific community has long supported Einstein's theory of General Relativity which explains that the gravitation force created by an object of a given mass creates a "dip" in the fabric of space time which in turn bends all things around it. If this was the case, then if an object of sufficiently large mass were to exist, it's gravity would be so great, that light itself could not escape it, and would be pulled into the object. An object of such mass, a black hole, would then, according to Einstein's calculations bend light as it passed just far enough of it to be bent by the dip in space time before being pulled in to the deeps blackness. This would mean that the light would appear to form a ring around the black hole in it's event horizon. 

A lot of astronomers, and theoretical physicists are wise enough to never undermine Einstein's conclusions, but the thought of it all being wrong did possible go through many of their minds. What if everything we understood about space time was actually incorrect? Well, today, Einstein's theory of relativity passed yet another crucial exam, and it did so gracefully. The EHT team's picture showed that the ring of light around the black hole's shadow was indeed there, just as mathematically predicted!

The picture shown is just about 100 kilobytes but was processed from about 5PB worth of data (as a Big Data Scientist, I can tell you this is no joke). The $29 million dollar picture, is truly remarkable and a landmark to human kind's history. 

I am just glad I got to see this moment, and I am excited to be part of a generation that will get to answer questions never answered before thanks to new technology. There is so much we don't know, I am just exctied to get to work!
