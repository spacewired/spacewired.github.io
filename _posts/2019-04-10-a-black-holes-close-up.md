This morning I could not contain my excitement as I watched the live feed from the National Science Foundation (NSF) where scientists were scheduled to deliver one of the biggest, most impressive news, my generation might ever get to see. The first image of a black whole. Today the effort and coordination of a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes has paid off. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is said to be "an earth-sized telescope", because it technically is! The telescope, in essence, is the successful connection of a worldwide network of eight pre-existing telescopes deployed at a variety of challenging high-altitude sites which included,Hawai'i, Mexico, Arizona, Spanish, Chile and Antartica.

The image released today is that of the black hole at the heart of the distant galaxy, Messier 87. While the EHT has been focused in capturing an image of the black hole at the center of our galaxy as well, the much larger size of the black hole in the Virgo galaxy and the location of it in respect to our current location in our own galaxy, made the Messier 87 black hole easier to capture.

Since the first mention of big news being released this Wednesday morning, astronomers began to ponder what the next steps would be if the first images of a black hole revealed an unexpected shape of the light bent around the black hole. The scientific community has long supported Einstein's theory of General Relativity which explains that the gravitational force created by an object of a given mass creates a "dip" in the fabric of space time which in turn bends all things around it. If this was the case, then if an object of sufficiently large mass were to exist, it's gravity would be so great, that light itself could not escape it, and would be pulled into the object. An object of such mass is what we call a black hole. The mass of a black hole, according to Einstein's calculations, bend light as it enters the black hole's event horizon. A circumference  just far enough from the center of the hole to begin pulling the light (think of it as the beginning if the "dip" in the fabric).  This would mean that the light would appear to form a ring around the black hole in it's event horizon. 

A lot of astronomers, and theoretical physicists are wise enough to never undermine Einstein's conclusions, but the thought of it all being wrong did go through many of their minds as stated in an amazin episode of The Planetary Radio. What if everything we understood about space time was actually incorrect? Well, today, Einstein's theory of relativity passed yet another crucial exam, and it did so gracefully. The EHT team's picture showed that the ring of light around the black hole's shadow was indeed there, just as mathematically predicted!

The picture shown is just about 100 kilobytes but was processed from about 5PB worth of data (as a Big Data Scientist, I can tell you this is no joke). The $29 million dollar picture, is truly remarkable and a landmark to human kind's history. 

I'm glad I got to see this moment, and I am excited to be part of a generation that will get to answer questions never answered before. You should get excited too! You just saw a black hole, a real one, something similar to what the center of our galaxy looks like, and that slowly pulls us in every day! I only wish Dr. Stephen Hawking had been here to see it.
